# Blaze Docs

This template is tuned for speed first.

## What you get

- Static HTML output with tiny runtime JavaScript.
- Worker-based search that loads only on demand.
- Strict size budgets enforced in CI.
- Hashed assets for robust cache busting.

## Philosophy

If a feature is not critical to reading docs, it should not block rendering.

## Next step

Read [Getting Started](./getting-started/) to customize this template.
